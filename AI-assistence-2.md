## Session [Statistical Analysis]

**Duration:** [8 hours]
**Objectives:** [Perform descriptive and inferential statistical analysis on the datasets (content.json, users.csv, viewing_sessions.csv), including measures of central tendency, outlier detection, distribution analysis, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, clustering, basic predictive modeling, and time series analysis. Additionally, create a well-organized and commented Jupyter notebook for submission as part of Phase 2.]

Time % = (2 / 8) × 100 = 25%

Content % = (1500 / 1500) × 100 = 100%

Complexity % = 95% (Very High complexity - comprehensive statistical analysis including multiple advanced techniques: descriptive stats, inferential stats, hypothesis testing, clustering, predictive modeling, and time series analysis)

Self-Assessment Score = 4 (on scale 1-5) = 80%

Final AI Assistance % = (0.25 × 25) + (0.35 × 100) + (0.25 × 95) + (0.15 × 80)
= 6.25 + 35 + 23.75 + 12 = 77%
